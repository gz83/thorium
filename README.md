# Thorium

<img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/thorium_ver_2048_grey_old.png" alt="Thorium logo">

## A cross-platform Chromium fork named after [radioactive element No. 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium)

- Targets Chromium stable releases while retaining Thorium's own patches, branding, and defaults.
- Intended to remain familiar to Chrome and Chromium users while exposing additional controls and restoring useful behavior.
- Release builds use compiler and linker optimizations including ThinLTO, PGO, and architecture-aware SIMD profiles. :boom:
  x86 build configurations are available for SSE2, [SSE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE3), SSE4.1, SSE4.2, [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions), [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2), and AVX-512. SSE2 is primarily a 32-bit Windows compatibility profile; standard desktop x64 builds use AVX, while explicitly named AVX2 and AVX-512 builds target newer processors. macOS, ARM, and Android builds use their platform-specific configurations instead. Release availability varies by platform and CPU profile.
  If you are unsure which one to download, see the [release and SIMD variant guide](./docs/ABOUT_RELEASES.md).

- Linux: [Thorium releases](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/releases)
- Windows: [Thorium Win](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win)
- Windows on ARM: [Thorium WOA](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-WOA)
- macOS for Apple silicon and Intel x64: [Thorium MacOS](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-MacOS)
- Android ARM32 and ARM64: [Thorium Android](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Android)
- Raspberry Pi ARM64: [Thorium Raspi](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Raspi)
- ChromiumOS-based releases: [ThoriumOS](https://github.com/Alex313031/ThoriumOS)
- Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1: [Thorium Legacy](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-legacy)
- Linux DEB repository and project website: [thorium.rocks](https://thorium.rocks/)

Choose a build that matches your CPU. A binary compiled for an unsupported SIMD profile may fail before the browser starts. See the [release and SIMD variant guide](./docs/ABOUT_RELEASES.md) before selecting a compatibility or optimized build.

### FEATURES & DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHROMIUM AND THORIUM <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/bulb_light.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" alt="Features"> <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/bulb_dark.svg#gh-light-mode-only" alt="Features">

#### Browser UI and Tabs

- Uses `thorium://` as the user-facing alias for internal pages while retaining canonical `chrome://` compatibility. This includes desktop and Android address-bar surfaces.
- Provides the optional Thorium 2024 UI with translucent inactive tabs, plus classic Omnibox and bookmark styling, rectangular tabs, custom tab widths, expanded theme colors, and platform menu controls. See the [Thorium 2024 UI explainer](./docs/TH24.md).
- Adds extensive tab controls: left- or right-aligned Tab Search, Pin/Unpin Tab Search, Restore Tab, Ctrl+Tab MRU, scrollable tabs, hover activation, custom close-button behavior, double-click/right-click tab closing, and "New tab to the left".
- Restores the classic Download Shelf behind `thorium://flags/#download-shelf`, enhances the downloads page, enables parallel downloading by default, and provides additional download notifications and controls.
- Adds close confirmation, close-window-with-last-tab, background-mode, quiet-notification, custom New Tab Page, auto-dark-mode, theme, avatar-button, extension-menu, and tab-hover-card controls.

#### Performance and Media

- Restores [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) URL handling and permits saving supported pages from additional schemes.
- Extends media support with FFmpeg HEVC/H.265, MPEG-2, AC-3/E-AC-3, WebRTC H.265 modes, platform media switches, and VAAPI/libva configuration.
- Provides Widevine integration where a supported bundled payload or external CDM is available and redistribution is permitted. Platform details and patch ownership are documented in [PATCHES.md](./docs/PATCHES.md).

#### Privacy and Networking

- Adds and enables [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/), disables Privacy Sandbox defaults, reduces DoH request headers, and offers controls for encrypted ClientHello, history retention, and clearing data on exit.
- Prevents URL elision by default, provides Thorium search-engine data and branded search icons, and keeps the local New Tab Page behavior configured by Thorium defaults.
- Disables unwanted startup/default-browser warnings, feature promos, AI entry points, alternate error pages, and remote field-trial fetching by default.

#### Extensions

- Preinstalls classic uBlock Origin when Chromium's preinstall provider processes a new supported profile. Existing profiles are not force-backfilled, and uninstalling it prevents automatic reinstallation.
- Includes Manifest V2 support, increased declarative-net-request limits, a quick extension toggle menu, and extension keyboard shortcuts.
- Includes experimental desktop-style extension support on Android and an option to enable extensions in Incognito.

#### Platform Integration and Tools

- Includes Thorium-branded Windows mini-installer UI, Linux DEB/RPM packaging and desktop integration, ChromeDriver, and `thorium_shell` packaging where supported.
- Includes <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/pak.png" alt="PAK utility" width="16"> [pak](./pak_src/README.md), a cross-platform utility for packing and unpacking Chromium [&#42;.pak](https://textslashplain.com/2022/05/03/chromium-internals-pak-files/) resources.
- Applies build, compiler, UI, privacy, media, installer, and platform patches through the audited order in [`patch_scripts/series/series`](./patch_scripts/series/series).

&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;Additional patches and useful `thorium://flags` entries are too numerous to list here.

- For ownership and implementation details, read [PATCHES.md](./docs/PATCHES.md). The active patch order is maintained in [`patch_scripts/series/series`](./patch_scripts/series/series).
- Report and track current bugs in the [Thorium issue tracker](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues).
- A list of Chromium command line flags can be found at > https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches
